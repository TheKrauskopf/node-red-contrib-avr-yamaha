# Node-RED nodes for Yamaha audio/video receiver (AVR)
This package contains nodes to easily integrate and control YAMAHAâ„¢ audio/video receiver from Node-Red (e.g. AVRs like the model Yamaha RX-677).

## Installation
Install using the managed palette from inside Node-RED.

## Usage
There are 3 new nodes which appear in the category 'devices' in your Node-Red palette.

![nodes.png](./doc/nodes.png)

#### AVR Yamaha
The node uses an UPnP-listener and emits a new message when certain events occur on the AVR. Look at `msg.topic` for the type of event and `msg.payload`
for some corresponding event information in JSON encoding.

The list of events is:

 * Power On/Off: When the power state was changed. Outputs current state by reading `System.Power_Control.Power`.
 * Input Changed: When the input selection changed. Outputs current state by reading `Main_Zone.Input.Input_Sel`.
 * Volume Changed: When the current volume setting changed or device is muted. Outputs current state by reading `Main_Zone.Volume.Lvl` and `Main_Zone.Volume.Mute`.
 * Play_Info Changed: When the current track changed. Outputs the current state by reading `<current input selection>.Play_Info`.
 * List_Info Changed: When the current menu list changed. Outputs the current state by reading `<current input selection>.List_Info`.

Note: In most situations, the receiver is sending the event notification multiple times via UPnP. This is not filtered, thus the node might emit the same information multiple times.

#### AVR Yamaha Get
The GET node is used to read different status values of a YAMAHA Audio/Video Receiver. You can select different topics to read the corresponding values
which are returned in `msg.payload`. Most of the payloads are returned as JSON string.

#### AVR Yamaha Put
The PUT node is used to write commands to a YAMAHA Audio/Video Receiver. Select a `msg.topic` in the editor. If no GUI selection is done, then the `msg.topic` is used.

#### Config Node
Use the config node to set the IP address of your receiver. The `port` option allows you to specify the port where the UPnP-device description will be queried. Leave empty for default value of 8080. Other devices, like
TSR-5790 use port 49154.

### Additional Information
Hint: To power on the AVR from remote, the network standby has to be enabled in the internal settings of the AVR.

### Example 1:
The following flow shows same basic control of the AVR.

### Example 2:
The following example shows a flow, that activates the AVR, sets it to a given volume and plays from a net radio. For example, if your AVR stands in the bedroom, you can use it as a radio alarm clock. To make sure, the
AVR doesn't play forever if you're not at home, the sleep timer is activated.

### Example 3:
The node `AVR Yamaha In` node listens to any UPnP event that is send to the receiver and emits
corresponding messages. Thus, it can happen, that multiple messages with the same content are emitted.
If you want to filter out these duplicate messages, then you can use the `rbe` node
to block out all messages without value changes. The stringify function is necessary because the `rbe`
node only works for strings and numbers.

![example3.png](./doc/example3.png)

    [{"id":"9202c38a.6dfd4","type":"avr-yamaha","z":"495ff459.b6a00c","name":"RX-677","address":"192.168.0.30","port":"8080","debug":true},{"id":"6e8384fe.917c7c","type":"debug","z":"495ff459.b6a00c","name":"","active":true,"console":"false","complete":"payload","x":650,"y":140,"wires":[]},{"id":"22311353.ddceec","type":"AVR-Yamaha-in","z":"495ff459.b6a00c","device":"9202c38a.6dfd4","name":"","devdesc":true,"x":160,"y":140,"wires":[["13a07ec2.47f281"]]},{"id":"56ad3cb2.17ed24","type":"rbe","z":"495ff459.b6a00c","name":"","func":"rbe","gap":"","x":490,"y":140,"wires":[["6e8384fe.917c7c"]]},{"id":"13a07ec2.47f281","type":"function","z":"495ff459.b6a00c","name":"stringify","func":"\nif (typeof msg.payload != 'string')\n    msg.payload = JSON.stringify(msg.payload);\n\nreturn msg;","outputs":1,"noerr":0,"x":340,"y":140,"wires":[["56ad3cb2.17ed24"]]}]


### Example 4:
It is also possible to inject the topic via the message instead of selecting one from the properties of node in the GUI.
This might also be usefull if your topic is not in the list of selectable topics. In the following flow, the topic and its value is injected by the inject node in front of it, instead by the `AVR Yamaha Put` node itself.

## Open Topics
- The AVR Yamaha node that listens for UPnP events might not work on every system. Most of the time, this is because there is already another
  UPnP service running and blocking port 1900 for other multicast listeners. Also check, that the Topic `System.Misc.Event.Notice` is written to `On`.
- The list of topics in the GUI is from the model RX-677. Although most of the topics are equal for the different Yamaha receivers, there might be some special topics,
  which are missing for newer models.

## List of verified devices
The nodes have been successfully tested with the following devices:
- RX-V677
- RX-A740
- TSR-5790 (uses port 49154)
- HTR-4065
